1 Tape RTM - works in 1 direction

Problems with choosing correct path in reverse:
    (1,((b,b),(b,1),(b,1)),0) -- Chooses this always
    (1,((1,1),(b,1),(b,1)),0)
    (1,((0,0),(b,1),(b,1)),0)
    

Small talk about infinite tapes -- We have a draft:
    But problems with shifting everything while reversible


    Our rule-tree is symmetrical (follow reversible style), but the rules can not go to different final states.
